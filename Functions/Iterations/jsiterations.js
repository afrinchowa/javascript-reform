JavaScript loops repeat executing a block of code a number of times.

Loops are fundamental for tasks involving:

Iteration over values
Iteration over data structures
Performing an action multiple times
Loop Type	Description
for	Iterates over values and expressions
while	Iterates over a condition
do...while	Iterates over a condition
for...in	Iterates over the properties of an Object
for...of	Iterates over array like objects
forEach()	Iterates over each element in an Array
The for Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known.

It consists of an initialization (exp1), a condition (exp2), and an increment expression (exp3).

Syntax
for (exp1; exp2; exp3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
exp1 is executed one time before the execution of the code block.

exp2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

exp3 is executed every time a code block has been executed.

Example
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
The while Loop
The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:

Example
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
Note
If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.

The do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, before the condition is checked.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
The example below uses a do...while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

Example
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10);
Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

The for...in Loop
The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.

It is typically used for iterating over object keys.

Syntax
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
A JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of a person object:

Example
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}
The for...of Loop
The for...of loop iterates over the values of iterable objects such as arrays, strings, Maps, Sets, and NodeLists.

Syntax
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
variable
For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.
iterable
An object that has iterable properties.
Other Methods
Array methods like forEach(), map(), filter(), and reduce() provide alternative ways to iterate and manipulate array elements, often offering a more functional and concise approach compared to traditional loops for array-specific operations.
